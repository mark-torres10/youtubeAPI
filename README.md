## Introduction

YouTube Podcast Integration is a Python-based project that solves the challenge of integrating podcasts uploaded to YouTube with an existing database. This project is designed to automate the process of fetching podcast data from YouTube, extracting relevant information, and seamlessly integrating it into an organization's database system.

## Problem Statement

Many organizations host podcasts on YouTube for their audience. However, managing podcast data, including titles, descriptions, upload dates, and URLs, can be cumbersome, especially when the organization's database contains crucial information about episodes and content. The pain point is to figure out how to streamline the integration of YouTube podcast data with the existing database without manual intervention.

## Solution Overview

This project provides a solution to the problem by automating the extraction and integration process. It leverages the YouTube Data API to fetch podcast details from YouTube channels, extracts relevant metadata, and integrates it with the organization's database system.

## Architecture

The architecture of the YouTube Podcast Integration project consists of the following components:

- **YouTube Data API**: Used to retrieve podcast data from YouTube channels.

- **Database**: Stores and manages podcast-related information. PostgreSQL is used as the database.

- **Python Script**: The main.py script orchestrates the entire process. It interacts with the YouTube Data API to fetch podcast data and interacts with the database to store the information.

## Tools and Technologies

The project uses the following tools and technologies:

- Python: For scripting and automation.
- PostgreSQL: As the relational database management system.
- YouTube Data API: To fetch podcast data from YouTube channels.
- Docker: For containerization and easy deployment.
- Redis: For caching and improving API response times.
- Elasticsearch: For full-text search and indexing.

## Getting Started
